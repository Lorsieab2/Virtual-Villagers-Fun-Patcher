# Village Statistics text-export research

## Confirmed local lifetime statistics

### A New Home

VV1's reachable local Statistics screen is `sub_431B30`. Its persisted manager
fields are:

| Statistic | Manager offset |
|---|---:|
| Points Earned | `+0x9E20` |
| Babies Made | `+0x9E24` |
| Food Gathered | `+0x9E28` |
| People Cured | `+0x9E2C` |
| Mushrooms Found | `+0x9E30` |
| Maximum Population | `+0x9E34` |
| Villagers Buried | `+0x9E38` |
| Oldest Villager | `+0x9E3C` |
| Island Events Seen | `+0x9E40` |
| Twins Birthed | `+0x9E44` |
| Triplets Birthed | `+0x9E48` |

Real Hours Played is calculated by `sub_41D0E0(manager)`. Puzzles Solved is
calculated from the sixteen persisted puzzle flags.

The block at `+0x9EEC` through `+0x9F1C` belongs to the separate Internet
statistics display and is not a substitute for the local values.

### The Lost Children

VV2 retains the corresponding local lifetime counters:

| Statistic | Manager offset |
|---|---:|
| Points Earned | `+0x2E4FC` |
| Babies Made | `+0x2E500` |
| Food Gathered | `+0x2E504` |
| People Cured | `+0x2E508` |
| Mushrooms Found | `+0x2E50C` |
| Highest Population | `+0x2E510` |
| Village Elders | `+0x2E514` |
| Oldest Villager | `+0x2E518` |
| Island Events Seen | `+0x2E51C` |
| Special Stews Found | `+0x2E520` |
| Triplets Birthed | `+0x2E524` |

Real Hours Played is calculated by `sub_425A90(manager)`. Puzzles Solved is
calculated from the sixteen persisted completion bytes at `+0x2E768`,
`+0x2E770`, `+0x2E778`, `+0x2E780`, `+0x2E788`, `+0x2E790`, `+0x2E798`,
`+0x2E7A0`, `+0x2E7A8`, `+0x2E7B0`, `+0x2E7B8`, `+0x2E7C0`, `+0x2E7C8`,
`+0x2E7D8`, `+0x2E7E0`, and `+0x2E7E8`.

## Later games do not retain equivalent local lifetime blocks

VV3 retains a Statistics UI shell at `sub_4639C0`, but its rows are
refresh/network controls rather than reads from a local lifetime-counter
block. VV4 and VV5 retain the older English localization labels but no
reachable local renderer or corresponding saved counter block.

VV4 and VV5's achievement trackers are not valid substitutes. Their counters
stop advancing when the achievement threshold is reached and therefore cannot
represent uncapped lifetime totals.

For VV3 through VV5 there are two honest implementations:

1. Export a clearly labeled snapshot containing only values derivable from the
   current saved village.
2. Add new sidecar-persisted lifetime counters at the relevant gameplay and
   catch-up mutation sites. Existing saves begin non-derivable counters at zero
   when the patch is first enabled.

## Safe update points

The text file should be refreshed after each successful full-save call. This
includes a normal close-time save without depending on an unproven
process-termination route, and it avoids exporting state from a failed or
partially normalized save.

| Game | Full-save wrapper | Wrapped call | Resume |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| The Secret City | `sub_427C60` | `sub_403530(this, this+8, 77596, slot)` | after successful call |
| The Tree of Life | `sub_41F030` | call at `0x41F13A` to `sub_4039B0` | `0x41F13F` |
| New Believers | `sub_4244F0` | call at `0x4245FA` to `sub_403940` | `0x4245FF` |

For VV4 and VV5, a detour must replace the five-byte full-save call itself and
return to the existing post-call instruction. The wrapper must preserve the
writer's Boolean result and export only after success. Slot-zero uses a
separate path and must not trigger a village-statistics export.
