"""A file pinned by its raw sha256 must also be pinned to LF line endings.

Several generators authenticate a data file by hashing its **whole bytes** and
comparing against a constant in `scripts/` or `src/` -- `ACTIVE_SHA256` in
`scripts/build_vv5_task9_native_actions.py` is the clearest example. A raw hash
covers line endings, so without a `text eol=lf` attribute the file's identity
follows whatever `core.autocrlf` the contributor happens to have.

That is not hypothetical. `data/vv5_origins_feature.json` carries exactly this
rule today, and `.gitattributes` records why in its own comment: a Windows
checkout and an LF checkout "settle to different chains and the generator's
identity check fails on whichever one did not produce the pin". Measured on the
committed blob:

    LF   sha256 6726AFB4...  == ACTIVE_SHA256   -> the build proceeds
    CRLF sha256 1983C284...  != ACTIVE_SHA256   -> "pinned active VV5 Origins
                                                    source drift", build stops

The failure is nastier than a line-ending complaint: it presents as a plausible
identity mismatch, which invites someone to "correct" the pin to the CRLF value
and bake the corruption in permanently.

The protection was applied to one file at a time as each was discovered, so 25
of the 28 raw-pinned files were still exposed. This test closes the class: the
set is derived mechanically rather than listed by hand, so a newly added pin is
covered the moment it appears instead of waiting to be found the painful way.
