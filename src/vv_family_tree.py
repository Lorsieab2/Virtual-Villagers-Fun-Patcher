"""The Family Tree Maker's family tree picture (src/vv_genealogy.py's village, drawn).

The owner (2026-10-07) showed a hand-made Secret City tree and asked for the same: one row per
generation, each villager with "the name, age in game units and years", "as many colors as needed
to distinguish the family lines", "pictures of the correct head values", and "twins and triplets
should be connected with a triangle".  Later the same day: the heads are "the same head sprite as
you use for the Origins Change Appearance menus"; "deceased villagers should not be faded (hard to
read), just put (deceased) in their entry"; and an expecting mother gets "another child with a
diamond portrait that says Upcoming child".

* Each villager is a frame -- square for a male, round for a female (the owner's example) -- with
  the head Change Appearance shows: the whole 40x65 cell of column 5 of the game's own head sheet
  in the game folder's Images, the row the head value, the young sheet at every age.
  Without the game folder the frame shows the initial instead.
* A baby on the way is a diamond, "Upcoming child", under its mother and the expected father.
* Each family -- a mother and father and their children -- has a colour of its own: the lines from
  the parents to the children, and the children's frames.  Founders' frames are grey.
* Children born together hang from one point of their family's line, which opens into a triangle.
* Villagers with no recorded parent or child sit apart, under "Other Members", level with their
  generation.
* The player's marks and edits (the owner: "mark special villagers with a border (any color) with a
  matching key", "make all the fields editable in case there are errors or the player wants to
  type something in a portrait"): every entry's lines, the title and the generation labels may be
  replaced, and any villager may carry a mark of the player's own -- a label and a colour -- drawn
  as a second border, every mark listed in the Key.  They are kept in the save folder's
  Virtual Villagers Fun Patcher Data\\Family Tree Edits, by villager (name, head and body), so a new tree
  keeps them.

The page is HTML with the tree in SVG; the picture (PNG or JPG) is drawn with Windows' own GDI+
(src/vv_gdiplus.py): nothing to install.
