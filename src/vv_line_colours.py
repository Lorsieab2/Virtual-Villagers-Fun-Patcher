"""Auto-colour family lines (the owner, 2026-10-09: "add a button for auto-coloring family lines in the
family tree maker. (should be distinct from other line colors and not blend into the background)").

Lines only: each family's lines get a colour of their own (Edits.family_lines[key]["colour"]); the family's
own colour, which its children's portraits share, is left as it was.

How the colours are chosen, the same tree always giving the same colours (nothing here is random):

* The candidates are a fixed grid spread evenly in OKLab, the perceptual colour space (equal steps look
  equally different): the whole RGB cube, not only bright hues (the owner, 2026-10-10: "any color possible means any color
  possible across the whole RGB values, meaning white, black, gray and brown are also included"): white
  and black, grays, browns, pastels, dark shades and every bright colour.
* Distinct from each other: the colours are chosen to make the closest pair of families as different
  (OKLab distance) as can be, families whose lines cross or run close together counting as closer than
  they are (their distance divided by 1 + how near their lines come, 0-1), so they end up the most
  different.  A greedy start and then rounds in which each family in turn takes the colour furthest from
  every other's; a round never makes the closest pair closer, and it stops when nothing changes.  Among
  colours nearly as distinct as the best, the one that stands out more from the background.
* Never blending into the background: the background is drawn exactly as the PNG export draws it
  (vv_gdiplus.backdrop_pixels: the colour, the gradient, the picture with its fit and opacity) and read
  under and beside every few pixels of each family's lines.  Where a family's colour, drawn at the lines'
  opacity, falls below WCAG non-text contrast (3:1, WCAG 2.1 SC 1.4.11) against any of those points, its
  lines get a thin casing (casings(): dark or white, whichever stands out more there, CASING pixels each
  side, under the line, at its opacity) -- in the editor, the PNG, the SVG and the preview alike, since all
  draw the scene.  A transparent background counts as both white (the editor and the PNG) and black (an
  SVG on a dark page); a point behind a portrait does not count.
Nothing but the standard library (the patcher's promise); GDI+ through vv_gdiplus on Windows.
